    "Vetores de palavras, ou Word2Vec, são representações muito usadas recentemente. Essas técnicas consistem em, geralmente, utilizar redes neurais artificiais simples com o objetivo de, dado uma palavra, prever a probabilidade da ocorrência de outras palavras nas proximidades. Porém, não se usa a rede neural treinada, mas os valores aprendidos como pesos da camada escondida são utilizados como representação para a palavra dada. Vamos estudar algumas arquiteturas diferentes.</p>\n"

    "<p> A Figura 1 abaixo, retirada de (McCormick, 2016), mostra como são obtidas as amostras para treinar uma rede neural no modelo Word2Vec com arquitetura Skip-Gram para a frase “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” (“A rápida raposa marrom pula sobre o cachorro preguiçoso”, numa tradução livre). Nesse exemplo, a palavra usada como entrada da rede neural é marcada em azul, enquanto o resultado esperado é uma das palavras dentro do quadro em destaque (que trata-se da janela escolhida para delinear a proximidade). </p>\n",

    "O modelo de rede neural nessa arquitetura se assemelha ao exibido na Figura 3. Nesse outro exemplo, trata-se de um conjunto de 10 mil palavras e a entrada mostrada na figura é a palavra “ants” (formigas). Observe que esta palavra é representada em forma de um hot-vector, ou seja, um vetor com 10 mil dimensões (o mesmo número de palavras), onde somente uma leva o valor 1, enquanto as demais são iguais a 0. Há uma camada de neurônios escondida e uma camada de saída. Por sua vez, na camada de saída, cada neurônio retorna a probabilidade de uma palavra estar nas proximidades (também há 10 mil neurônios, ativados pela função Softmax). Essa rede é treinada com todas as ocorrências de cada palavra no corpus, e os pesos estabelecidos para a camada escondida são escolhidos como a representação dessa palavra (nesse exemplo, um vetor de 300 elementos).\n",

    "* Skip-gram: Funciona bem com poucos dados de treino, representa bem até mesmo palavras ou frases raras.\n",

    " <p>A intuição por trás do GloVe está no fato de que a probabilidade de co-ocorrência entre duas palavras será sempre alta para palavras de mesmo contexto (que são naturalmente associadas), e baixa para palavras sem relação de contexto. Esses dois casos representam ruído no modelo, como pode ser observado no exemplo abaixo, extraído de um corpus real de 2 bi. de palavras.</p>\n",
